				"# 🧠 Knowledge Base: Common Questions\n",
				"\n",
				"### Q1: What other options can we convert SQL tables to?\n",
				"DuckDB is a \"Universal Translator.\" You can convert results into almost any major format:\n",
				"| Method | Target | Use Case |\n",
				"| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
				"| **`.df()`** | **Pandas** | The \"Old Reliable.\" Best for small data. |\n",
				"| **`.pl()`** | **Polars** | The \"Speed Demon.\" Much faster than Pandas. |\n",
				"| **`.fetchnumpy()`** | **NumPy** | Best for Machine Learning (tensors/arrays). |\n",
				"| **`.fetchall()`** | **Python List** | Best for simple app logic. |\n",
				"| **`.to_arrow_table()`** | **Arrow** | Best for interoperability. |\n",
				"\n",
				"### Q2: `arrow_table.to_pandas()` — What is it and what else?\n",
				"Arrow is **Memory-only**. It’s just a \"Binary Block\" of data. To interact with it, you convert it:\n",
				"- **`.to_pandas()`**: Converts Arrow to a Pandas DataFrame (very fast).\n",
				"- **`pl.from_arrow(arrow_table)`**: Move it into **Polars** (Zero-Copy king).\n",
				"- **`arrow_table.to_pylist()`**: Convert to a standard Python list.\n",
				"- **`arrow_table.to_batches()`**: Break it into small \"chunks\" for streaming.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Q3: Why use Arrow to save to Parquet instead of just DuckDB?\n",
				"Technically, DuckDB can save to Parquet directly: duckdb.sql(\"COPY table TO 'file.parquet'\")\n",
				"\n",
				"SO WHY USE ARROW?\n",
				"1. **Engine Independence**: Arrow is a universal language. You can swap engines later without changing your save logic.\n",
				"2. **Streaming**: Arrow is designed to \"pipe\" data between systems (e.g., Database to Web API).\n",
				"3. **Metadata Control**: PyArrow gives you surgical control over Parquet settings (compression, etc.).\n",
				"4. **Zero-Copy**: Arrow is a zero-copy format, meaning it can be read by multiple systems without copying the data.\n",
				"🎓 The \"Golden Rule\" of this Stack:\n",
				"Use DuckDB to query/crunch the data, but use Arrow to pass that data around. This is why we call it the \"Zero-Copy\" stack—Arrow is the bridge that keeps everything fast.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Q4: Is Zero-Copy lost when using Polars (Level 2)?\n",
				"**No!** Polars uses Apache Arrow as its internal memory format. When you call `.pl()`, DuckDB places data into an Arrow block, and Polars simply points its \"eyes\" at it. No copying happens.\n",
				"```\n",
				"graph LR\n",
				"    A[DuckDB Engine] -- \".pl()\" --> B(Arrow Memory Block)\n",
				"    B -- \"Zero Copy\" --> C[Polars DataFrame]\n",
				"\n",
				"```\n",
				"DuckDB: Queries the data.\n",
				"The Transfer: When you call .pl() in DuckDB, it doesn't \"copy\" the data into Polars. Instead, it places the data into an Arrow Memory Block.\n",
				"Polars: Points its own \"eyes\" at that exact same memory block.\n",
				"\n",
				"🧪 Proof you can see in your code:\n",
				"```python\n",
				"# This one line handles the whole \"Zero-Copy\" bridge automatically\n",
				"polars_df = duckdb.sql(\"SELECT * FROM users\").pl()\n",
				"```\n",
				"\n",
				"🧠 Why we use Polars instead of raw Arrow?\n",
				"Raw Arrow Table: Great for storage and moving data, but very hard to code with. (Try doing a GROUP BY in raw Arrow—it's painful!)\n",
				"Polars: Gives you a beautiful, easy API (like Pandas) to do complex data science, while still using the speed of Arrow underneath.\n",
				"Summary:\n",
				"You aren't losing the Zero-Copy logic in Level 2; you are harnessing it.\n",
				"\n",
				"Arrow is the Track.\n",
				"Polars is the High-Speed Train running on that track.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Q5: What is the best practice for writing Parquet: `arrow_table` or `polars_df`?\n",
				"| Method | Best For... | Why? |\n",
				"| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
				"| **`polars_df.write_parquet()`** | **Data Science & Logic** | Fast, multithreaded (Rust), and convenient. |\n",
				"| **`pq.write_table(arrow_table)`** | **Infrastructure & Transport** | Maximum control over metadata and compatibility. |\n",
				"\n",
				"1. Polars (polars_df.write_parquet())\n",
				"Best For: When you are doing logic (filtering, joining, calculating).\n",
				"The Difference: It uses a high-performance Rust-based writer. It is incredibly fast for local files because it is multithreaded by default.\n",
				"Practice: If the data is already in a Polars DataFrame, always use df.write_parquet().\n",
				"2. PyArrow (pq.write_table(arrow_table))\n",
				"Best For: Pure infrastructure and \"handing off\" data.\n",
				"The Difference: It is the \"Industry Standard.\" It gives you surgical control. You can set specific Parquet versions, custom encryption, or compression levels (like Zstd level 22).\n",
				"Practice: Use this when you are building a \"bridge\" between two systems (like DuckDB and a Cloud Bucket) and don't need to do any Python-based math on the data.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Q6: What exactly is the \"Arrow Bridge\" (The Analogy)?\n",
				"Think of your data flow like **Water**:\n",
				"\n",
				"The arrow_table you created is the actual \"Bridge\" (the data itself), and pyarrow (pq) is the construction worker that uses that bridge to build a file.\n",
				"\n",
				"Here is the breakdown of the \"Bridge\" in your code:\n",
				"\n",
				"1. The Bridge (The Data Format)\n",
				"Object: arrow_table\n",
				"Role: This is the data sitting in your RAM. It is no longer \"owned\" by DuckDB. It is now in a universal format that Polars, Pandas, and Spark all understand perfectly.\n",
				"Why we call it a bridge: Because it allows data to move between different software engines without being \"re-written\" or \"re-formatted\" (Zero-Copy).\n",
				"2. The Worker (The Tool)\n",
				"Object: import pyarrow.parquet as pq\n",
				"Role: This is just the library (the \"construction tool\") that has the instructions for how to take an Arrow Table and save it as a Parquet file on your hard drive.\n",
				"🎨 The Analogy:\n",
				"Think of your data like Water:\n",
				"\n",
				"DuckDB is a high-tech Pressure Tank. It's great for swirling the water around (SQL), but it's hard for other people to use that specific tank.\n",
				"arrow_table is a Standard Bucket. You've poured the water out of the tank and into a bucket that everyone in the neighborhood recognizes.\n",
				"pyarrow (pq) is a Funnel. It’s the tool you use to pour that bucket into a Glass Bottle (the Parquet file) so you can keep it in the fridge forever.\n",
				"Summary:\n",
				"DuckDB = The Engine (Querying).\n",
				"arrow_table = The Bridge (The Memory-Format)."
